A scoreboard project for the Scrimba JavaScript course Iâ€™m taking right now!
this project allows you to count up scores in either +1, +2 or +3 for either teams: Home or Guest
and the leading team will be highlighted in red, you can also add fouls to either team 
lastly a timer will be started when you launch the website and you can reset all the scores and the timer by pressing the new game button
(pssst stick around for the end of the game for a very cool horn sound!)
Enjoy!
